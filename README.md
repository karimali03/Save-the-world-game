# War Plane Game

Welcome to the War Plane Game! This is a simple Python game built using the Pygame library where you control a warplane tasked with launching rockets to destroy incoming enemies before they reach your plane. The enemies move from left to right and vice versa, changing direction when they reach the edges of the screen and descending closer to your plane as they progress. When an enemy is destroyed, it respawns in a random location with a random appearance.
